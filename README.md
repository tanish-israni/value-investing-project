üöÄ About The Project

This application was built to solve the challenge of manual, time-consuming stock research. It implements a quantitative approach to value investing by systematically ranking stocks based on a variety of key financial metrics.

The core logic reads a dataset of Nifty 500 company fundamentals and calculates a unified "Relative Value (RV) Score" for each stock. This score is derived from the percentile ranks of five different metrics:

* Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
* Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
* Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio
* Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)
* Enterprise Value to Gross Profit (EV/GP)

The application then selects the top 50 stocks with the best RV Scores and allocates the user's capital, creating a diversified portfolio of high-value companies.
